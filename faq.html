    <h3>How do become a 1337 h4x0r???</h3>
    <p>
      Time and practice. Nobody has ever become the best at what they do over night.
      The pros that rose from the '70s and '80s started with taking a computer and picking it apart.
      A good starting place to become a hackerman would be learning assembly and reverse engineering- this sets you up to think like a computer.
